# car-detection
Implemented a car detection project using Detectron2 for object detection in a dataset of images. The objective was to identify cars by creating bounding boxes around them. The output was a CSV file containing image filenames and corresponding bounding box coordinates for each detected car. Detectron2, a deep learning library, was employed for its robust capabilities in object detection tasks. The project successfully utilized advanced computer vision techniques to automate car identification, demonstrating the power and efficiency of state-of-the-art models in image analysis. The outcome contributes to automating object detection processes in various applications.
